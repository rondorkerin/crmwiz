----
Here is the pitch for his company:
Stealth Scaling evaluates, builds, tests, and operates your automation initiative from start to finish. No complicated licensing requirements, lengthy training classes, or hidden fees.
​
We deliver instant scalability and reliable outcomes at a predictable, transparent price.
​
Stealth's team of Automation Specialists work with subject matter experts to identify and evaluate key pain point within your business; processes that are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and don't add value to the business overall.
​
Once target processes are selected, they are prioritized and our specialists get to work. We walk through each process with your team, documenting every step the user takes within the applications they use every day to complete their work.
​
Documented processes are then validated by the client to ensure every aspect of the process has been accounted for and documented. Once you sign off, robot configuration begins.
​
Our automation engineers configure each robot exactly to specification. Each new robot goes through several rounds of rigorous testing, ensuring that your new digital workforce is delivering the results you expect, before being deployed in the live environment.
​
Your digital workforce is always under the watchful eye of our sophisticated Robotic Command Center, as well as our automation operators (humans in the loop) who are ready to handle any errors or exceptions, should they occur.
​
At the end of every day, you receive an outcome report showing what your digital workers did that day.
